My name is Claire O'Connor and I'm a first year PhD student at University of Maryland's iSchool. My research focuses on leveraging large language models (LLMs) as assistive communication tools for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) users, with the goal of facilitating common ground in everyday conversations. I employ a participatory design approach, collaborating with AAC users, caregivers, and clinicians to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and to promote independent self-expression. As a speech-language pathologist, I have worked with AAC users who frequently encounter communication challenges, including delayed response time and limited vocabulary, which hinder their ability to express their wants and needs. Through my research, I aim to develop AI-assisted tools that empower AAC users to communicate more independently and effectively.
